Welcome to the website of Saahil Aneja! 
I'm very excited to share my experiences with you, but first, let me tell you about myself!

Facts:
-I was born in Michigan in November 2005, to amazing parents. I couldn't ask for better ones! 
-My mom is an artist, why don't you give her a visit at www.archanaaneja.com
-My dad's an engineer, and he recently got his truck driving license. He's the one who gave me my sense of humor. (No offense Mom!)
-I never learned how to crawl. I went from slithering on the floor to walking.
-I had a couple of fish when I was young. My favorite was named after my idol at that time. Lightning McQueen. 
-Cars was my favorite thing of all time.
-My fish died after a little while, but I believed that they were stars in the sky. Hopefully no one saw me having conversations with the sky at night and calling a star Lightning McQueen! 
-After growing up a bit we moved to another city in Michigan.
-I was very excited to start Kindergarten. We met a lot of friends, and I used to enjoy playing with them a lot!
-From a young age I practiced ice hockey, tennis, and swimming. 
-In 2011 my baby sister was born. Unlike most siblings, we get along very well. 
-My first device was a Nintendo DS, which developed my love for video games!
-I have always been fond of dogs, but SOMEONE (coughparentscough) doesn't want to get one, and I see their point, about how dogs are hard to take care of, but still! 
-I have tortured my mom by setting a picture of a dog as her phone home and lock screen, and my poor untechie mom had't figured out how to change it until I took pity and changed it back.
-I loved drawing, and still do!
-When I was six we moved to Germany.
-We stayed in Germany for 4 years. I loved being able to travel a lot, and to see how different Germany was from the U.S!
-I stayed in an international English speaking school, which was good, because the german language is HARD!
-I was chosen for a math competion, MATH QUEST, along with three other people to travel to Barcelona and represent my school!
-I started programming using the websites www.scratch.mit.edu and www.code.org That's how I discovered my love of coding!
-Eventually I moved on the the software Python! After making a program which helps people learn their multiplication tables, my principal gave me an opportunity to start a coding club at my school!
-I was selected for the student council of my elementary school in Germany.
-I was part of a group selected to record lines for the German transportation system, Ubahns.
-After my dads expat assignment was finished, we moved back to Michigan!
-I attended 6th grade when I came back.
-I was selected for my schools Student Lighthouse (leadership team).
-I took part in both the Math Olympiad and a little bit of the Geography Bee at my school. (I'm more of a spelling type of guy) 
-Still pushing to get a dog, but there's no chance. Time to brainstorm some new ideas!
-I got my video game console, Nintendo Switch, and enjoy playing games on it! Instead of playing video games, why not invent my own? I started taking a deeper intrest in coding so I can become a software engineer when I grow up!
-I play Tennis and am aiming to get into the highschool team.
-I am now attending middle school, and plan to keep coding and working on this website!

Thanks for reading!
