SAAHILISMS AND JIYAISMS!

Quippable quips attributed to me and compiled by my parents over the years.
Here you will find funny quotes from my sister, Jiya, and me. Written from my dad's point of view.

#Jiyaisms
*Jiya striking a meditation pose on the family room table and chanting &#39;Om&#39;*
Me: Jee, What are you doing?
Jiya: I&#39;m meditating so that I can get to my happy place.
*Walks away in a huff after 30 seconds*
Me: What happened, Jee? Didn&#39;t you get to your happy place?...
J: It’s taking a long time.

#Jiyaims
*While having Mexican Chicken Tortilla soup for dinner.*
Jiya: Mumma, Let me guess. This is Hindi soup because it has rice in it.

#Jiyaisms
*Jiya on getting her turn as the &#39;star leader of the week&#39; in her Kindergarten class.*
&quot;Daddy, I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment my whole life.&quot;

Nowadays, Google just doesn&#39;t give you what you need. #Saahilisms #homeworkblues #firstworldproblems

#Saahilisms

*Last evening, while helping Saahil with some pie-charts for his school project*

Saahil: I love having a dad who knows technology.

*And tonight, when Dad is working late*

Saahil: I wish I knew how to make &#39;chai&#39; so that I could make it for you.

*This kid melts my heart!*

#Jiyaisms

Me: Hey Jee, Did you learn any Math in school today?
Jee: Yes.
Me: What did you do?
Jee: Well, projects, of course! And, activitity.

*Activitity sounds way cooler than activity.*

I think that I may be going through a serious mid-life massage crisis. That awkward phase of life when
your older kid is too heavy, and your younger one too light, to walk on your back.

#Saahilisms

*Humming/singing an old Bollywood song from &#39;Akele Hum Akele Tum&#39; while teasing Archana for no
good reason.*

Me:
♫Dil mera churaya kyun
Jab yeh dil todna hee tha

Why did we fall in love?

Why did you break my heart?♫

Saahil (interrupting me): Perhaps it was because of your singing.

*This kid pulls no punches!*

Ever tried, ever failed, no matter;
Try again, fail again, fail better!

#Jiyaisms

You know that you&#39;re traveling in airplanes a bit too much when the first words your four-year old can
read are &quot;Exit Row&quot;.

#Jiyaisms

So, 6 has a big tummy and 9 has a big head?

#knowyournumbers

#Saahilisms

*While fooling around with Saahil&#39;s guitar after he was done practicing for his school concert*

Saahil: Dad, no offense but I think that if our livelihood depended on singing, I would make more money
than you.

*Brutal honesty*

#Jiyaisms

Jiya: Daddy, you need to come for dinner. Your mother (referring to Archana) said so.
Me: You mean that my wife said so.
Jiya: No, that&#39;s mom. That&#39;s your mother.
Me: Silly goose, dadi is daddy&#39;s mother.
Jiya (defiantly): No, dadi is your &#39;Indian&#39; mother. And, mom *is* your mother.

*Not only do our kids have a severe identity crisis, they are completely confused. Clearly, we have failed
as parents.*

#Saahilisms

*While driving back after a nice family dinner*

Arch (to me): Mark the 24th on your calendar. It is the annual multi-cultural night in Saahil&#39;s school.
Me: Which team is he part of this year - the U.S.A. one or the Indian one?
Arch: He has no specific team affiliation, which also means that he can dress up either in Western
clothes or in Indian ones.
Me: Saahil, perhaps you can do a fusion theme this time i.e. dress up in Indian-American hybrid style.
Saahil: Yeah, right! Because nothing says cool like a guy wearing a tuxedo coat and a lungi.

#Saahilisms

*Losing my religion*

*A few weeks back on St. Patrick&#39;s Day*

Saahil (to one of his Irish school teachers): Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day, Miss J.
Miss J: Thank you, sweetheart. Are you Catholic?
Saahil: No, my family and I are international Hindus.

#Saahilisms

*After getting tired of Mom&#39;s persistent, but valid, reminders to take care of his school homework and
related stuff for Monday morning.*

Saahil (with a distressed, almost aggravated look on his face): You have no idea how hard my life is!

#Jiyaisms

*When Mommy picked up Jiya from the day-care, Jiya&#39;s friend C was also being picked up by her Dad.
As Jiya and C walked out of the day-care, they decided to hold hands.*

Jiya: Mommy, Since C and I are holding hands, you can also hold hands with C&#39;s Dad.

*Jiya, the matchmaker! Trying to hook up my wife with my friend.*

#Jiyaisms

*While dropping off Jiya to her day-care this morning.*

Me: Have a nice day, sweetie!
Jiya: I don&#39;t think I will. We have ballet today and I hate ballet.

Me: Sweetie, we don&#39;t use the &#39;hate&#39; word.
Jiya: Well, I *really* don&#39;t like ballet.
Me (trying my best leadership negotiation strategies): Well, it can&#39;t be all that bad. There must be some
parts that you like. How about Daddy&#39;s favorite twirly step that you like to perform for Daddy?
Jiya: There is one part that I like.
Me (smugly, sensing an opening): Which one?
Jiya: The part when it ends.

*End of negotiation!*

#Saahilisms

Me: Hey bud, how was school today?
Saahil: Good! It looks like we will be learning dance in PE class. And, the hallway rumor is that boys will
have to dance with girls.
Me: That&#39;s good, isn&#39;t it?
Saahil: Well, it depends.
Me: On?
Saahil: Depends on whom you end up dancing with.

*This kid is growing up way too fast.*

MORE TO COME!
